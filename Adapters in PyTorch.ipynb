Common strategies include adjusting only the final layer or fine-tuning all layers. However, these methods have their drawbacks: fine-tuning just the final layer often leads to less than optimal results, while fine-tuning all layers can be very time-consuming.\n","\n","To address these issues, researchers have developed various parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. One such technique involves the use of adapters. Adapters enable modular training, where small, task-specific modules are trained within the model without changing the pre-existing pretrained parameters. This approach efficiently tailors the model to new tasks with a reduced risk of overfitting. However, adapters are not a cure-all solution. While they are less likely to overfit and are computationally efficient, they might not always reach the same level of accuracy as full model fine-tuning, particularly if the task necessitates substantial changes from the pretrained model's original capabilities.\n","\n","In this hands-on lab, you learn how to apply an adapter to a transformer-based neural network that has been trained on the AG News data set, with the aim of using this model on the IMDB data set. You also evaluate and compare the performance of this method with that of a fully fine-tuned model and a model where only the last layer is fine-tuned.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5c082f03-2920-4661-a356-e0e28c5f93a0","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# __Table of contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Install-required-libraries\">Install required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Import-required-libraries\">Import required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Define-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Positional-encodings\">Positional encodings</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Import-IMDB-dataset\">Import IMDB data set</a></li>\n","    <ol>\n","        <li><a href=\"#IMDB-dataset-overview\">IMDB data set overview</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Dataset-composition\">Data set composition</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Applications\">Applications</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Challenges\">Challenges</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Dataset-splits\">Data set splits</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Data-loader\">Data loader</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Neural-network\">Neural network</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </ol>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Training\">Training</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Train-IMDB\">Train IMDB</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Fine-tune-a-model-pretrained-on-the-AG-News-dataset\">Fine-tune a model pretrained on the AG News data set</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Fine-tune-the-final-layer-only\">Fine-tune the final layer only</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Adapters\">Adapters</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Benefits-of-using-adapters-in-neural-networks\">Benefits of using adapters in neural networks</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Exercise:-Adapt-linear-layers-in-a-different-network\">Exercise: Adapt linear layers in a different network</a>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3096c319-4842-4296-a4be-e8312439eec9","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1e60d280-d336-43b8-870a-4495e16052e5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab, you are able to:\n","\n","- Define and pretrain a transformer-based neural network using PyTorch for a classification task [Optional]\n","- Fully fine-tune the pretrained model for a different classification task [Optional]\n","- Compare results by fine-tuning only the last layer of the pretrained model [Optional]\n","- Understand how adapters work\n","- Apply adapters to linear layers in a neural network\n","- Train a neural network in a parameter efficient way by training just the adapted layers\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3b9e0b7e-897b-4f64-a02b-670e9c5b3865","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"aa228f4f-af08-4fbe-acb3-3242ec0b1905","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e729079f-d70c-4ed6-9781-f6b22900296e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Install required libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"35af2474-4d10-4be0-bfef-fc1ebe084422","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, you use the following libraries, which are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the code in the following cell__ to install them.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0c675cd-0164-432f-ae9a-3a277749ab1b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[" __Note__: The package installation step may take a few minutes to complete.
