    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will classify aircraft damage using a pre-trained VGG16 model and generate captions using a Transformer-based pretrained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: \"dent\" and \"crack.\" For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Aim of the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop an automated model that accurately classifies aircraft damage from images. By the end of the project, you will have trained and evaluated a model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore, the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images, providing a detailed description of the damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trained model capable of classifying aircraft images into \"dent\" and \"crack\" categories, enabling automated aircraft damage detection.\n",
    "- A Transformer-based model that generates captions and summaries of images\n"
