Perplexity is commonly used to compare different language models or different configurations of the same model.\n","After training, perplexity can be calculated on a held-out evaluation dataset to assess the model's performance. The perplexity is calculated by feeding the evaluation dataset through the model and comparing the predicted probabilities of the target tokens with the actual token values that are masked.\n","\n","A lower perplexity score indicates that the model has a better understanding of the language and is more effective at predicting the masked tokens. It suggests that the model has learned useful representations and can generalize well to unseen data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"f735aa2b-d9c1-4c5c-b1a3-f2299d3cb210","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["'''eval_results = trainer.evaluate()\nprint(f\"Perplexity: {math.exp(eval_results['eval_loss']):.2f}\")'''"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"84a07d70-91de-42bf-ac2a-0337a21f6940","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Loading the saved model\n","If you want to skip training and load the model that you trained for 10 epochs, go ahead and uncomment the following cell:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"e4578d82-b14a-499f-9e53-0e490834df3b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#!wget 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/BeXRxFT2EyQAmBHvxVaMYQ/bert-scratch-model.pt'\n#model.resize_token_embeddings(30522)\n#model.load_state_dict(torch.load('bert-scratch-model.pt',map_location=torch.device('cpu')))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"549b0f97-69d7-4afb-ae0f-83e50606ab50","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["The simplest way to try out the model for inference is to use it in a pipeline().
